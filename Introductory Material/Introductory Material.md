## Getting Started with Getting Started
Complexity is not a unified field or topic and the study of complex systems directly is probably at its weakest point since the peak hype when the Santa Fe Institute was founded to around 2012. That does not mean complexity is dead by any means; you can find insights, terminology, techniques, methods, and philosophy from mainline complexity in a lot of very different fields. The structure of these notes reflects the transdisciplinary nature complexity has taken on.

Expanding on that a little further, I think there are two aspects to studying complexity. One is to look where complexity occurs and is being studied as such in disparate disciplines. Seeing the same-seeming problems popping up in areas as different as forestry and economics can give one a feel for what it is we are trying to get to the root of. The second aspect is studying complexity as a cluster of topic areas. [[Hiroki Sayama]] in his book [[Introduction to the Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems (2015)]] presents a cluster that I think is a fairly good place to start. He identifies the following areas: Nonlinear Dynamics, Game Theory, Collective Behavior, Networks, Systems Theory, Pattern Formation, and Evolution and Adaptation. 

We can see some of these various disciplines and topic areas reflected in the backgrounds of the mainline complexity researchers.
### Backgrounds Helpful for Studying Complexity
All else being equal, the more quantitative the better. Math and physics, computer science and engineering, biology, meterology, etc. 
I find a lot of non-quantitatively minded people have plenty of intuition for complexity, though. Some of the most intelligent/academically successful people I've ever met were mainly gifted with reductive thinking. They could break problems down, examine them, and build them back up. That exact approach, reductionism, is extremely difficult with complex systems - its kind of the hallmark of them. So even if someone is not quantitatively gifted, a "holistic" mindset is very beneficial. All the better if its informed with scientific / mathematical tools and thinking. 
I think the problems in this area are so difficult for us to crack because it takes such a blend of inductive and deductive thinking trained across the spectrum of structured human studies. So the most important prerequisite, above all, is passion and interest in a wide range of topics and well-tempered autodidacticism. 
## Booklist (Best Read in Order)
[[Complexity - The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos (1992)]]
Covers the founding of the Santa Fe Institute and really captures the intutions and frustrations the various scientists had that revived this iteration of the area. Goes over some foundational people and topics. 
[[Chaos - Making a New Science (1987)]]
...
At this point you should honestly have plenty of paths to pursue on your own. Will update with some foundational books by topic later.
