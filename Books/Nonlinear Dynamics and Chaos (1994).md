by [[Steven Strogatz]]
### Overview
#### History
Strogatz outlines a basic history of dynamics, starting with [[Isaac Newton]]'s solution for Kepler's Laws and moves on to [[Poincare]] and his analysis of the [[Three-Body Problem]]. Poincare developed a geometric approach that emphasized quantitative questions for the dynamics of a many-body system.
Nonlinear oscillators then make an appearance in physics and engineering - studied extensively by people like [[Balthazar van der Pol]], [[Aleksandr Andronov]], [[ML Cartwright]], [[JE Littlewood]], [[Norman Levinson]], and [[Stephen Smale]].
[[Poincare's Geometric Methods]] were extended to the understanding of classical mechanics by [[George David Birkhoff]], [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], [[Vladimir Arnold]], and [[Jurgen Moser]].
In 1963 [[Edward Norton Lorenz]] discovered chaotic motion on a strange attractor.
[[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] made some key discoveries of universal laws governing the transition from regular to chaotic behavior. 
[[Benoit Mandlebrot]] wprled pm fractals.
[[1980s]] - Widespread interest in chaos, fractals, oscillators, etc.
