# Outline
## Foreword: Interaction and Innovation
*by William Tracy and Casey Cox*
SFI's Annual Applied Complexity Network (ACtioN) and Board of Trustees Symposium and the *Dialogues of the Applied Complexity Network* series is based onthe nonlinear nature of the multiple feedback mechanisms embodied in interactions between agents and their ecology.
Each November, ACtioN gathers a diverse group of people and faciliates conversations.
## Complexity Economics: An Introduction
*by [[W. Brian Arthur]], Eric D. Beinhocker, Allison Stanger*
A bit of history:
September, 1987: Conference held at SFI organized by [[Philip Anderson]], [[David Pines]], and [[Kenneth Arrow]]. The first SFI research program "The Economy as an Evolving Complex System" came from this meeting - "Complexity Economics."
2014, and 2019 SFI devoted its annual symposium to complexity economics.
The first major critics of the equlibrium model of economics - Joseph Schumpeter, Friedrich Hayek, Herbert Simon, Kenneth Boulding, and Elinor Ostrom.
Through [[John Holland]] and others, agent-based modeling was adopted. Other methods were used to glean insights into human prosocial behaviors as well including laboratory work, archaelogical and anthropological data, game theory, etc.
Jean-Claude Trichet, then president of the European Central Bank called for "inspiration from other disciplines (sciences)... where they have developed sophisticated tools for analyzing complex dynamic systems."
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a major effort called "New Approaches to Economic Challenges" with the explicit mission of bringing complexity-economics thinking into policy.

## Complex Economies: From the Keynesian Orbit to the Darwinian Worm
*by David C. Krakauer*
"This meeting is in some sense an effort to assay the status of this effort... How have advances in computer simulation, nonlinear dynamics, network theory, and the theory of computation, overcome significant theoretical challenges of the complex domain?"
The question also is of the application of new economic theory.
## Can Complexity Economics Save the World?
*by Eric Beinhocker*
This talk is derived from my forthcoming book "Market Humanism." The thesis is that in order to change the economic system - to create a system that is more inclusive, prosperous, and sustainable - we have to change the ideas that built the system.
In this talk we sketch out where the current economic ideology and system came from, why they are so damaging, and how new economic thinking could lead to a new ideology.
"What is the economy? What kind of system is it?"
Hunter-Gatherer -> Agriculture -> Industrial Revolution -> Modern Capitalism
We need to be succeeding on both the material and social levels as well as in biophysical impact.
The current imagined order -> Economic System (Market Capitalism) -> Economic and Political Ideology (Neoliberalism) -> Economic Theory (Neoclassical Economics) -> Behavioral Theory (Homo Economicus) -> Moral Philosophy (Maximizing Utilitarianism)
Walrasian equilibrium system ideas - 
	Greed is good, Maximizing pleasure from consumption is the goal, a billion acts of selfishness will lead to a prosperous society, the social duty of business is to maximize profit, there is no such thing as society, only individuals, markets are efficient while other institutions are not, the value of something to society is its market price, you're paid what you're worth, you have to choose between equity and growth, and the environment is a resource to be exploited. GDP is a proxy for human welfare and the point of the economy is to maximize it.
Newer ideas
	The economy is a kind of order creating system, that takes inputs -matter and energy - from low order/high entropy and transforms them through a metabolism into all the products etc in the economy. It utilizes knowledge from physical and social tech and produces waste. 
New imagined order:
	Moral Philosophy (Prosocial Behaviors) -> Behavioral Theory (Homo Sapiens) -> Economic Theory (Complexity Economics) -> Economic and Political Ideology (Market Humanism) -> Economic Systen (Eudiamonic Economy)
