## Course Description
In this course, we will learn selected unsupervised learning methods for dimensionality reduction, clustering, finding latent features, and application cases such as recommender system with hands-on examples of product recommendation algorithms.
## Program Learning Outcomes
Successful completion of this course demonstrate your achievement of the following learning outcomes for the MS-CS program:
- Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
- Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.
- Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.
- Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
- Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline.
- Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.

## Outline
### Module 1
#### Simple Linear Regression
Covers chapter 3.1-3.2 of ISLR
General form: $Y={\beta_0}+{\beta_1}X + {\epsilon}$ 
We try and estimate the coefficients, and identify the intercepts.
#### Estimating Coefficients - Least Squared Method
Chapter 3.1.1 of ISLR
#### Linear Regression Model Evaluation
Chapter 3.1.2 Assessing the Accuracy of Coefficient Estimates
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Percent Absolute Error (MAPE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Chapter 3.1.3 Assessing the Accuracy of the Model
Model Fitness and R-Squared
Coefficient Significance and Test Error
