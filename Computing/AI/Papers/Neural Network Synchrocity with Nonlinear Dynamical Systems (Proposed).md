## Gestalt
Need a neural network, maybe NEAT, and a method for one:one mapping to a dynamical systems equation.
If NEAT is used, I would like a live visual of the network and a display of the function mapping being performed. 
I need a dynamical systems model of some arbitrary complexity, one that can bounce between stability and chaos, edge of chaos. 
Do I want the NN to help drive parameters to stability/chaos/in-between - or towards some other characteristic?
Once the model is in that state, do I want to try and tune the network to ...
