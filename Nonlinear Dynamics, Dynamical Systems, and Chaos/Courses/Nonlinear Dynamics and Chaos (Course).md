## Syllabus
**Description**
This graduate level course focuses on nonlinear dynamics with applications. It takes an intuitive approach with emphasis on geometric thinking, computational and analytical methods and makes extensive use of demonstration software.

**Outline of the Course**
A rough idea follows. Some things may be covered in more detail than this implies, or the reverse. This is just to give you an idea of the “flavor”.
- One-dimensional systems and elementary bifurcations.
- Two-dimensional systems; phase plane analysis, limit cycles, Poincaré-Bendixson theory.
- Nonlinear Oscillators, qualitative and approximate asymptotic techniques, Hopf bifurcations.
- Lorenz and Rossler equations, chaos, strange attractors and fractals.
- Iterated mappings, period-doubling, chaos, renormalization, universality.
- Hamiltonian systems; complete integrability and ergodicity.
- Area preserving mappings, KAM theory.
- Other: Floquet theory, Infinite Dimensional Hamiltonians, On-Off Dissipative Systems, etc.
