**Definitions**
A system of differential equations on $R^2$ is said to be *Hamiltonian* with one defree of freedom if it can be expressed in the form:
$dx/dt = \partial{H}/\partial{y}$
$dy/dt=-\partial{H}/\partial{x}$
Where $H(x,y)$ is a twice-continously differential function. The system is said to be conservative and there is no dissipation. The Hamiltonian is defined by 
$H(x,y) = K(x,y) + V(x,y)$
Where K is kinetic energy and V is the potential energy
**Theorem 1 (Conservation of Energy):** *The total energy H(x,y) is a first integral and a constant of the motion*
