Notes from Intro to the Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems

+ Classifications of Model Equations:

Linear System - A dynamical eq whose rules involve just a linear combination of state variables
NonLinear System - A dynamical eq whose rules can involve squares, cubes, radicals, trig etc of state variables
First-Order System - A difference eq whose rules involve state variables of the immediate past (t-1) only
Higher-Order System - A difference eq whose rules can involve further time steps back (t-2, t-3) etc
Autononmous System - A dynamical eq whose rules don't explicitly include time or any other external vairables
Non-Autonomous System - A dynamical equation whose rules do include time t and other external variables explicitly

* * Autonomous first-order equations can cover all the dynamics of any non-autonomous, higher-order equation * *
Autonomous first-order equations == Iterative Maps
