Intro to Complex Systems:
	Topics covered include evolutionary systems, self-organized criticality, measures of complexity, approaches to modeling complex adaptive systems, and emergence. Authors covered include Holland, Barabasi, Wolfram, Axelrod, Kauffman, Bak, and Gell-Mann

Intro to Adaptive Systems:
	This course is an introduction to applications and integration of dynamical systems and game theory to model population and ecological dynamics and evolutionary processes. Topics include Lotka-Volterra systems, non-cooperative games, replicator dynamics and genetic mechanisms of selection and mutation, and other adaptive systems.

Theory of Complex Systems:
	A math-based introduction to the theory and analysis of complex systems. Methods covered include nonlinear dynamics, both discrete and continuous, chaos theory, stochastic processes, game theory, criticality and fractals, and numerical methods. Examples include population dynamics, evolutionary theory, genetic algorithms, epidemiology, simple models of markets, opinion formation models, and cellular automata.

Computer Modeling of Complex Systems:
	Introduces students to basic concepts, tools, and issues which arise using computers to model complex systems. Emphasis is placed on the modeling process itself, from model design through implementation to analyzing, documenting, and communicating results. Case studies of computer models of complex systems, including adaptive and non-adaptive complex systems drawn from economics, ecology, immunology, epidemiology, evolutionary biology, political science, and cognitive science.

Theory of Social and Technological Networks
	Introduces and develops the mathematical theory of networks, particularly social and technological networks; with applications to important network-driven phenomena in the epidemiology of human infections and computer viruses, cascading failure in grids, network resilience, and opinion formation. Topics covered: experimental studies of social networks, WWW, internet, information, and biological networks.

Intro to Nonlinear Dynamics and the Physics of Complexity:
	An introduction to non-linear science with an elementary treatment from the point of view of the physics of chaos and fractal growth.

Ecology Networks // Mathematical Ecology
	Networks have revolutionized the way we understand, represent and analyze complex systems. In particular, Ecology has greatly benefited from network theory to analyze the (inherently complex) structure and dynamics of ecological systems. This course introduces fundamental concepts and recent ecological theory on the structure and dynamics of networks composed by species connected via antagonistic (e.g. who eats whom) and/or mutualistic (e.g. plant-pollinator) interactions. These concepts and theories will be introduced via lectures and regular reading of primary literature, and actively learned via individual and group analysis of empirical data, mathematical models and computational tools. We will also elucidate how to use ecological networks to inform real-world problems such as the current environmental crisis.

	The study of ecology is the study of complex systems that are intrinsically dynamic and quantitative. Ecologists formulate mathematical models to describe this complexity; the equations that result are interesting both for their biological predictions and their mathematical form. Full analytical solution of model equations is typically impossible, yet to the mathematically prepared mind, they can yield up their secrets.

	This course is intended to provide students with the tools needed to formulate and analyze ecological models. It is an overview of the major categories of models and the mathematical techniques available for their analysis. Although the focus is on ecological dynamics, students in other disciplines will find the methods readily applicable to their own fields.

Introduction to Information Theory for the Natural Sciences:
	This course introduces the basic tools of Information Theory. Entropy, Relative Entropy, and Information, and highlights their utility with applications drawn from various disciplines. After introducing the basics of probability theory and information theory, we explore topics including coding, data compression, channel capacity, thermodynamics, population dynamics, gene transcriptions, network science and more.

Advanced Topic I:
	As a general measure of uncertainty, Entropy finds diverse applications in numerous disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, and biology. This course will highlight many of these applications. After introducing the basic notions of entropy and information, we will study the theoretical underpinnings of its many interpretations. Illustrations of these ideas will be drawn from information theory, statistical inference, statistical mechanics, network theory, and biophysics.





Dynamical multilayer networks, scaling, statistical mechanics of algorithmic dynamics, evolution and co-evolution, and information theory

The theory of complex systems is the experimental, quantitative, and predictive
science of generalized matter interacting through generalized interactions.

Complex systems are co-evolving multilayer networks.
