## Curriculum Outline

I don't do well focusing on one thing at a time, and don't think thats the best way to approach this all anyway. At the same time, I can't flutter from one thing to another. I'll have to balance this cycling, sampling, exploratory learning with something more disciplined. For the rest of 2023 I'm going to stay loose and informal, with the general goal of ingesting as much material as possible, collecting resources, and getting a lay of the land. Starting next year I'll have hard objectives on a weekly and monthly basis, as well as set time for unstructured exploration. 

Some objective types:
Reading research papers, textbooks, and implementing libraries/open source projects. Benchmarking!

Possible goals:
Complete course certificates, attempt a research paper, write medium blog posts, make some github projects presentable
Texts: "MARL", "Design Patterns", "Practical ML with Python", "Intro to ML", Gurney's older NN book, Goodfellow and Bengio's "Deep Learning", Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning Yearning", Mitchell's "An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms", Chip Huygen "Designing Machine Learning Systems: An Iterative Process for Production-Ready Applications", "Serious Python" and then "Fluent Python", 
Papers: Literally infinite amounts of them. Prioritize by researchers that I like or are relevant right now, papers from conference proceedings, foundational papers. I should be reading at least three a week, ideally one a day. Another great approach is to take the most relevant techniques/architectures and trace back the papers building to now. The papers surrounding orgs, too like OpenAI. 

Topics / Areas
History of Machine Learning
	- Earliest ideas, evolution, important people and works, dead ends

Mathematics of Machine Learning and AI

Traditional Machine Learning
	- Backpropogation, Gradient Descent, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, etc.
	- Might need to split this into multiple courses: Introduction, RL, Deep Learning

Traditional Neural Networks

Learning Alogirthms

Applications and the Traditional Ways They're Architected
	- Imaging, NLP, robotics, etc applications and how they are similar or different

Modern Hardware (GPUs, TPUs, etc)
	- Different architectures and the trends around them, how they're applied to ML, benchmarking metrics, modern GPU/TPU hardware

Evolutionary Strategies
	- Start from most basic, go through a couple of the most popular ones including the theory and implementation, end with Quality Diversity and do a serious implementation of it
	- Understand benchmarking and apply them to the benchmarks
	- Maybe try your own ES

Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs)
	- Deep dive into CPPNs including implementations

Neuroevolution
	- NEAT, EANT, Applying Evolutionary Strategies to Evolving Topology and Weight ANNs and CPPNs
