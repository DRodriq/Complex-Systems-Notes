- Notes from Papers
{	From "Comparison of NEAT and HyperNEAT on a Strategic Decison-Making Problem"
	HyperNEAT improves upon NEAT for relatively simple fractured problems, but the benefits disappear as the problem gets more complicated. This is based on this experiment only and should be tested on other problems
	Look into "fractured problems"
	Some work has been done to extend NEAT for performance on fractured problems. Kohl and Mikk (2009) demonstrated that NEAT's performance on several fractured problems can be improved if a mutation is added to the algorithm that allows the addition of radial basisc function nodes (RBF-NEAT). Also suggests that NEATs performance could be improved if its search space were constrained to cascade architectures, a network arrchitecture in which each hidden node is connected to all hidden nodes to its left in addition to inputs and outputs (Cascade-NEAT)
	More future work would be improving implementations for computer performance

}
{	From "Quality Diversity: A New Frontier for Evolutionary Computation"
	Natural evolution isn't just perfromance optimization, it is a divergent search that optimizes locally within each niche as it simultaenously diversifies. Discovery is of both quality and diversity -> Quality Diversity (QD) Algorithms
	Novelty Search (Stanley and Lehman 2008, 2011a) has effectively shown that evolutions talent for diversification can itself be harnessed as a powerful tool for seeking a near-optimum.
	Quaity Diversity seeks to find a maximally diverse collection of individuals in which each member is as high performing as possible. One algorithm is Novelty Search with Local Competition (Lehman and Stanley 2011b) and MAP-Elites (Mouret and Clune 2015)
	In QD, diversity between individuals is measured with respect to behavior, from which an experimenter selects some subset of behavioral features of interest to form a behavior characterization. These behavior spaces must be divided into niches that together cover the entire space.
	Mouret and Clune 2015 - QD effectively reveals the best possible performance achievable in each region of the phenotype space

	NEAT-based methods are categorized based on 
		1. Whether they consider issues specific to the search space or fitness landscape
		2. Whether they combine principles from NE and another domain or
		3. The particular properties of the evolved ANNs
}
{	From "A Systematic Comparison of Simulation Software for ..."
	A recent example of a digital twin solution for a robotic
	arm can be found in [8] where the authors used ROS to achieve seamless operation between
	the real and digital world
	From our review and experimental results, we found
	that current robot simulation software could not be used
	to develop a digital twin. This is because the simulators
	considered in this paper cannot maintain a repeatable simulated scene over time. We hypothesise that a continuous
	feedback mechanism is needed between the simulation and
	reality similar to [22] in order to maintain an accurate
	representation of the real environment -> 22: â€œSim2Real2Sim: Bridging the Gap Between Simulation and Real-World in Flexible Object Manipulation

{	From "Neuroevolution Through Augmenting Topologies"
	- Many systems have been developed over the last decade that evolve both neural network topologies and weights (Angeline et al., 1993; Braun and Weisbrod, 1993; Dasgupta and McGregor, 1992; Fullmer and Miikkulainen, 1992; Gruau et al., 1996; Krishnan and Ciesielski, 1994; Lee and Kim, 1996; Mandischer, 1993; Maniezzo, 1994; Opitz
	and Shavlik, 1997; Pujol and Poli, 1998; Yao and Liu, 1996; Zhang and Muhlenbein, Â¨1993)
	- TWEANNs can be divided between those that use a direct encoding, and those that
	use an indirect one. Direct encoding schemes, employed by most TWEANNs, specify
	in the genome every connection and node that will appear in the phenotype (Angeline et al., 1993; Braun and Weisbrod, 1993; Dasgupta and McGregor, 1992; Fullmer and Miikkulainen, 1992; Krishnan and Ciesielski, 1994; Lee and Kim, 1996; Maniezzo,
	1994; Opitz and Shavlik, 1997; Pujol and Poli, 1998; Yao and Liu, 1996; Zhang and
	Muhlenbein, 1993). In contrast, indirect encodings usually only specify rules for con- Â¨
	structing a phenotype (Gruau, 1993; Mandischer, 1993).
	- Subgraph swapping is representative of a prevailing philosophy in TWEANNs that subgraphs are functional units and therefore swapping them
	makes sense because it preserves the structure of functional components
	- Several different problems with TWEANNs
}
{	From "Efficient Reinforcement Learning through Evolving Neural Network Topologies"
	- As of 2002, NE methods were the strongest method on the pole-balancing benchmark RL tasks, but evolving topology was not yet done much. 
	- NEAT is introduced focused on principled crossover, protection of structural innovation, and using incremental growth from minimal structure
	- NEAT, and NE generally is a way of learning with sparse reinforcement
	- Pole-balancing NE results were gained from evolving weights on fixed topologies
	- An open question then (answered now?) is whether Topology evolution can enhance performance, and if so if its worth the tradeoff of increased difficulty
	- Topology evolving method called Cellular encoding (Gruau 1996) was compared to ESP (Gomez and Miikulainen 1999). ESP was 5 times faster even tho it uses a random number of hidden nodes
	- NEAT's genetic encoding is nothing special other than its innovation number. It uses connection and node genes, with mutation occuring on the weights and addition of nodes.

NEAT Framework
(1) Is there a genetic representation that allows
disparate topologies to crossover in a meaningful way? 
(2) How can topological innovation that needs a few generations to optimize be protected so that it does not disappear
from the population prematurely? 
(3) How can topologies be minimized throughout evolution without the need for a
specially contrived fitness function that measures complexity?

What if? :
+ Instead of tracking genes through historical markings and the innovation number, any gene can be tagged as a line up point, and what genes are or are not tagged is a part of speciation 
- When species reproduce, they will produce several candidate zygotes. Most will have inherited number of line up points, but some will have one extra, one less, or a shifted one. 
- If the reproducing agents have contributed any zygotes with the same # of lineup points, they will each contribute a zygote for crossover. Therefore speciation is defined by number of lineup points
+ There were some weight training / learning method applied on agents during their lifespan
- Some percentage of the difference between their natural weight and the end learned weight were applied to offspring
- When weights on a connection are decreased enough, the connection is killed. 
- When weights on a connection are increased enough, the connection splits into two neurons
