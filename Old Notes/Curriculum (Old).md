 + Curriculum Outline

History of Machine Learning
	- Earliest ideas, evolution, important people and works, dead ends

Traditional Neural Networks and Machine Learning
	- Backpropogation, Gradient Descent, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, etc.
	- Might need to split this into multiple courses: Introduction, RL, Deep Learning

Machine Learning Applications
	- Imaging, NLP, robotics, etc applications and how they are similar or different

Machine Learning and Hardware
	- How ML is applied to different hardware, benchmarking metrics, modern GPU/TPU hardware and how it is applied to ML

Evolutionary Strategies
	- Start from most basic, go through a couple of the most popular ones including the theory and implementation, end with Quality Diversity and do a serious implementation of it
	- Understand benchmarking and apply them to the benchmarks
	- Maybe try your own ES

Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks
	- Deep dive into CPPNs including implementations

Neuroevolution
	- NEAT, EANT, Applying Evolutionary Strategies to Evolving Topology and Weight ANNs and CPPNs

Distributed Systems
	- Basic concepts and how it applies to ML. Need to do more research to even structure a course for this

Robot Simulation
 	- Look at available platforms, how to use them and the trade offs

Course Goals:
	Four items: Concepts, Mathematics, Implementation, "Outlook"
