Prominent Researchers in Complex Adaptive Systems:
John H. Holland: Known for his work on complex adaptive systems, genetic algorithms, and the concept of emergence.
Robert Axelrod: His research focuses on the study of cooperation, complexity, and social dynamics using agent-based modeling.
Joshua M. Epstein: Epstein's work involves agent-based modeling and its application to social systems, epidemiology, and public policy.
Melanie Mitchell: A leading expert in complex systems, Mitchell has contributed significantly to the understanding of complex adaptive systems, artificial intelligence, and computational modeling.
John H. Miller: Miller's research spans various aspects of complex systems, including agent-based modeling, computational social science, and economics.

"Introduction to the Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems" by Hiroki Sayama.
"Complex Adaptive Systems: An Introduction to Computational Models of Social Life" by John H. Miller and Scott E. Page.
"Growing Artificial Societies: Social Science from the Bottom Up" by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell.

"Structure and Dynamics of Complex Networks" by Mark E. J. Newman: This book delves into the structure and dynamics of complex networks, covering topics like random graphs, small-world networks, scale-free networks, and community structure. It provides insights into the analysis of real-world networks and their behavior.
