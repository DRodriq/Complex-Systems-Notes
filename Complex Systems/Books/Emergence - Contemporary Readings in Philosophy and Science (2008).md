## Outline
### Introduction
A few important questions are outlined:
**1. How Should Emergence be Defined?**
Leading ideas in different definitions of emergence include irreducibility, unpredictability, conceptual novelty, ontological novelty, and supervenience. Some definitions include one or many of these, and we cannot presume that only one type of emergence exists to be defined. 
**2. What Ontological Categories of Entities can be Emergent?**
Properties, substances, processes, phenomena, patterns, laws...?
**3. What is the Scope of Actual Emergent Phenomena?**
Which aspects of the world can be characterized as emergent? We talk of consciousness and other aspects of the mind, life, physical aggregations of inert or logically acting agents.
**4. Is Emergence an Objective Feature of the World?**
Or is it dependent on the observer? Is it characterized on in models or descriptions, or does it actually exist in nature? Is it just a function of something is viewed or explained? 
Candidates for emergent phenomena in real world include *spontaneous symmetry breaking*.
An example of emergence reflecting our limited ability to understand the world is the R-pentomino pattern in Conway's Game of Life where a stable pattern takes 1103 iterations to occur. 
**5. Should Emergence be Viewed as Static and Synchronic, or as Dynamic and Diachronic, or both?**
In synchronic emergence, the emergent feature is simulataneously present with the basal feature from which it proceeds (consciousness and brain activity).
Diachronic emergence; the base precedes the emergent phenomena which develops over time from it like with a traffic jam.
Philosophical literature usually discusses synchronic emergence, while scientific literature discusses diachronic. 
A further question about diachronic is whether and how it applies to both discrete and continous systems.
**6. Does Emergence Imply or Require the Existence of New Levels of Phenemenon?**
Many discussions of emergence include the terminology of levels or hierarchy. These "levels" have three distinctive features
	- The hierarchy has no precisely defined order but is determined implictly by the organizational complexity of objects.
	- Each level is assumed to contain at least one kind of object and one kind of property that is not found below that level
	- At each level kinds exist that have novel causal powers that emerge from the organizational structure of material components
**7. In what Ways are Emergent Phenemenon Autonomous from their Emergent Bases?**
Emergent properties are "Janus faced"; they depend on more basic phenomena and yet are autonomous from that base. If emergence is to be coherent, it must involve different senses of dependence and independence. A number of different ideas have been discussed - including the ideas that emergent properties are irreducible to their bases, inexplicable from them, unpredictable from them, supervenient on them, and multiply realizable in them. Emergent properties are sometimes thought to be novel. Is this epistemological or ontological?
*An extreme version of the merely epistemological interpretation holds that emergence is simply a sign of our ignorance.*
One final issue about the autonomy of emergent phenemona concerns whether emergence necessarily involves novel causal powers, especially powers that produce "downward causation" - properties of emergence that affect the base consituents. 
### An attempt to answer some of these questions before reading on -
*How should emergence be defined?* 
I am leaning towards that so called extreme epistemological interpretation. Latching onto the "ignorance" aspect, it really seems like an information hiding and expressing issue, or from a dynamical systems perspective, qualitative differences in a system as subtle changes occur to lever points.
*What ontological categories of entites can be emergent?*
None. An entity can't have emergent properties, only a system of many entities...? More seriously, I don't think I understand this question well enough.
*What is the scope of actual emergent phenemona?*
To me, emergence seems most interesting when you have a complexification, ordering, or self-organization of the basal constituents. Most examples seem to revolve around simple entities suddenly exhibiting a behavior that seems directed by a greater intelligence (fish schools, flocks, insect colonies), or a sudden reversal in entropy like with spin glasses or magnetic alignment. Even more interesting and more "emergent" seeming is when this organization is self-sustaining or self-reinforcing. Insects colonize to survive and to continue colonizing further. The only universal law seems to be that matter wants to scatter to the winds and stay in a low energy state, so when we see matter organizing or sustaining itself beyond that, exactly that behavior seems to be what is of interest. 
*Is emergence an objective feature of the world or is it dependent on an observer?*
I might be equating self-organization with emergence too much, but I would say yes. The entire interest of complexity, to me, is that by all appearances matter should just scatter. Yet entities randomly aggregated together exhibit some collective, system-like, self-reinforcing coherence, a collective-bargaining with the universe, and that collective behavior tunes the downward causation either disrupting, encouraging, or evolving the basal system and so the emergent behavior and on and on. Its a loop. The fact we have complexification at all when all our physics promises is entropy seems proof its an objective reality. 
*Should Emergence be Viewed as Static and Synchronic, or as Dynamic and Diachronic, or both?*
I don't think it matters.
*Does Emergence Imply or Require the Existence of New Levels of Phenemenon ?*
Yes. If you need aggregates for emergent properties, I think creating a "new level" treating the aggregates as a system more or less divorced from the rules of the aggregates is natural.
*In What Ways are Emergent Phenemenon Autonomous from their Emergent Bases?*
Depends on the system. I'm sure there are a ton of examples of emergent phenemenon that destroys or otherwise disorganizes the base thus destroying / ending the phenemenon. What is interesting is when the emergent properties help sustain and guide the aggregates towards some higher goal - long term survival of a colony beyond the lifetime of any of the members or species evolution that takes generatiosn of coherent behavior to happen. That interplay of aggregate behavior -> emergent property -> aggregate behavior -> ... turning simple entities into more complex systems is what seems to be of interest. 
### Introduction to Philosophical Perspectives on Emergence
The significatn resurgence of interest in emergence seems to have occured for two reasons. One is that emergence once again has become an attractive position in attempts to understand the mind (chapyers 3, 4, 7).
Two is that many philosophers are inspired by recent attention to emergence in contemporary science (chapters 5, 6, 8, and 9).
**Leading Ideas about Emergence**
A central question addressed by most chapters is how to characterize emergent phenemona more precisely. Irreducible, unpredictable, novel concepts, holistic. 
**The Scope of Emergence**
There is a widely held view (the sparse view) that if emergence exists at all, it will appear only in unusual types of phenemenon that tend to fall outside the scope of normal science like consciousness. [[Jaegwon Kim]]'s position in chapter 7 is one contemporary representation of the sparse view.
Revival of interest in emergence has resulted in part from candidates for emergent phenemona that either occur at very basic levels of the ontological hierarchy (physics) or are quite common. Quantum entanglements would be an example of the first (apparently). It is worth considering if rather than being rare, emergence is quite common. 
[[William Wimsatt]] (chapter 5), [[Paul Humphreys]] (chapter 6), [[Mark A. Bedau]] (chapter 8), and [[Daniel Dennett]] (chapter 9) provide reasons supporting this view. Wimsatt argues emergence is the rule, generally arising in some form when a system has properties not governed by conservation laws. 
One key decision iis whether the accounts should describe how emergence could occur, leaving the issue of existence of real cases an an optional further issue. 
**Irreducibility and Mystery**
A failure to be reduced is often viewed as a necessary condition for emergence. Reduction can mean a variety of things, one one standard view is that a phenomenon has been reduced if it has been explained in terms of more fundamental properties (why?). This creates an association with mysticism. 
Many hold that emergence is compatible with reduction, but to what extent are they explainable? Chapters 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 offer starkly different answers.
