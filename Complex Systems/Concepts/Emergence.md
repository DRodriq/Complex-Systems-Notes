## Personal View
I wanted to write my personal intuitions before diving in. I will leave this here and will add to it as the study evolves. I think it will be interesting to see how my views will evolve. This is based on earlier notes over the years. 
- I came to complex systems initially because of a similiar frustration with reductionism that seems to have motivated a lot of other people (Complexity, Waldrop). I think some people have a brain that is like a scalpel that can slice and disect and break things down to components and see how they interact, and other people have brains like a gelatinous cube that digests things all at once. I am firmly in the second camp and had a horrible time in engineering school developing step-by-step approaches or learning about systems component by component. 
- At the same time, emergence seems like a sophomoric / mystical "everything is connected" kind of lazy stoner idea. I also can't shake the deep conviction that if we can't define it and quantify it, its not a useful idea. The question to me seems to be why are some systems better to be treated as a coherent whole while others are better broken down in to subsystems? My natural tendency, as discussed above, is to lean to the mystical "everything is connected" anti-reductionism, but my other natural tendency is to try and rigourously destroy my preconceptions. Finally, I think seeing interesting behavior and boxing it up as "emergence" is obfuscating something very interesting and real. So we land on:
	- I don't think true 'emergence' exists. The closest thing to a real definition I've seen is that emergence is "information at a higher level that does not exist at a lower level." In the common conception of emergence as higher-level behavior of aggregate agents (ants and ant colonies, individual trades and economies), I don't accept that the information "does not exist" at the lower level. Information clearly has an important role to play here, though, because it is not expressed in some hierarchies/situations but is in others. Returning to the question of why some systems are better analyzed as a whole instead of as subsystems with neat boundaries may reveal how this information hiding and expression relates to emergence.
- This has been brewing since starting to study nonlinear systems and chaos: We have plenty of examples of relatively simple systems that can sample a space for a long time and go through many evolutions before suddenly changing behavior or settling on a periodic pattern. To say the information does not exist in the initial equations would be nonsense, it just isn't apparent without analysis of the system. 
## History
Its beyond the scope and my personal ability to address the history of emergence in Eastern thought and would probably fall into some orientalist mess, so I will stick with western thought. The literature I am sampling also does not have much to say on ancient notions of emergence / holism / reductionism / dualism or related ideas though it is clearly an old idea and there is no shortage of atribution of emergent-seeming mentions by Socrates, Aristotle, Galen, or others.  
So we will stick to semi-modern Western thought as emergence has been directly studied.

## General Outline of How Emergence is Treated
Emergence is not well defined or agreed on. It is mostly defined through analogy or example; a sort of "you know it when you see it" sort of thing. We will collect such examples here, some of which are contested for various reasons of interest. This lack of definition is especially urgent given that emergence is not just a philosophical topic, but is very relevant in science. The concept just may be one of the crown jewels of philosophy of science. The desired outcome would hence be a philosophically rigorous and empirically useful understanding.
A few common themes to the discussions and examples:
- Irreducibility
- Unpredictability
- Conceptual Novelty
- Ontological Novelty
- Supervenience


[[David Pines]] in the following [Medium article](https://medium.com/sfi-30-foundations-frontiers/emergence-a-unifying-theme-for-21st-century-science-4324ac0f951e): Emergence thus refers to collective phenomena or behaviors in complex adaptive systems that are not present in their individual parts.
Examples given by Pines: birds flocking, fireflies synchronizing, ants colonizing, fish schooling, individuals self-organizing into neighborhoods in cities – all with no leaders or central control – to the Big Bang, the formation of galaxies and stars and planets, the evolution of life on earth from its origins until now, the folding of proteins, the assembly of cells, the crystallization of atoms in a liquid, the superconductivity of electrons in some metals, the changing global climate, or the development of consciousness in an infant.
